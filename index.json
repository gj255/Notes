Mathematically, we say that the complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$ is not planar.\nHowever, it is possible to draw such a graph on the surface of a torus. Indeed, on a torus it is possible to connect each of four homes to each of four utilities, without any lines of connection crossing (an exercise for the curious).\nA natural question to ask is: what is the surface of lowest genus $g$ on which it is possible to connect $n$ homes to $n$ utilities, without crossings?\nA Bound Here is a lower bound on the genus required. Suppose the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ can be drawn without crossings on the genus-$g$ surface. Let $e = n^2$ denote the number of edges in the graph, $f$ the number of faces, and let $\\chi = 2 - 2g$ denote the Euler characteristic of the surface.\nThe shortest cycle in $K_{n,n}$ has length four. Thus each face of the graph must have at least four sides, and since each side is shared by two faces, we must have\n$$ 2 e \\geq 4 f \\ .$$\nBy definition, we have $2n - e + f = \\chi$. Thus we can write the above inequality as\n$$ \\frac{e}{2} \\leq 2n - \\chi = 2(n + g - 1) \\ .$$\nThus we find that\n$$ g \\geq \\frac{(n-2)^2}{4} \\ . $$\nWe hence find (for example) that for $n=3,4$ we must have $g \\geq 1$, whilst for $n = 5$ we must have $g \\geq 3$.\n","date":1631145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631145600,"objectID":"36a3ab4e9c46c9f28c8530e16928f6ee","permalink":"/blog/graph/","publishdate":"2021-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/graph/","section":"blog","summary":"Given $n$ homes and $n$ utilities living on some compact surface, can we connect each home to each utility without any of the connections crossing?","tags":null,"title":"Utilities Problem on General Compact Surfaces","type":"blog"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Chapter 0 Solutions.\nThese are my solutions to the problems in Chapter 0 of Allen Hatcher\u0026rsquo;s Algebraic Topology.

A sequence of length $k$ has $2^k$ subsequences and checking each case may not be feasible.\nA Solution Suppose our sequence begins $(1,10,11,12,2,3,\\ldots)$. If we begin our subsequence with $a_1 = 1$, we are left with the decision whether to next take $a_2 = 10$, thus committing to the exclusion of $a_5$ and $a_6$, or whether perhaps to skip the second to fourth elements in the hope of finding more elements less than $a_2$ further down the line. Which decision is better could depend on elements all the way to the end of the sequence.\nThus, one is tempted to start thinking from the other end. Suppose we begin with $a_k$. Clearly there is nowhere else to go, and our longest subsequence will have length one. Now suppose we begin with $a_{k-1}$. We have hardly more choice in this case: we include $a_k$ if it is greater than $a_{k-1}$, and not otherwise.\nNow suppose we begin with $a_{k-2}$. We have already determined the longest subsequence beginning with $a_i$ for each $i \u0026gt; k-2$. Thus, we need only check which such $a_i$ satisfy $a_i \u0026gt; a_{k-2}$, and of those, prepend $a_{k-2}$ to the longest corresponding subsequence. This will generate the longest subsequence beginning with $a_{k-2}$.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s clear we can continue this process, tracking backwards through the sequence to determine the longest ascending subsequence beginning with each element, and once this is complete we can choose the longest among them as our solution.\nAn Implementation One way to implement this idea uses Python dictionaries:\na = [1,10,11,12,2,3,4,13,14,15,5,6,7,8] k = len(a) # prepend a small number a_0 so that the longest subsequence necessarily begins with a_0 a = [min(a)-1] + a # create a dictionary of the longest subsequences starting from a_i longsubseq = {k : [a[-1]]} for i in reversed(range(k)): # restrict the dictionary to those j with a_j \u0026gt; a_i lss = {j: longsubseq[j] for j in range(i, k+1) if a[j] \u0026gt; a[i]} # from these choose m such that a_m begins the longest subsequence m = max(lss, key = lambda j: len(lss[j]), default = 0) # append this subsequence to a_i if m == 0: subseq = [a[i]] else: subseq = [a[i]] + longsubseq[m] longsubseq[i] = subseq solution = longsubseq[0][1:]  I don\u0026rsquo;t know that Python dictionaries are necessarily the fastest way to implement this idea, but they are conceptually clean at least.\n","date":1619568000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619568000,"objectID":"471f7c95685b43e7cf93ad492f68404a","permalink":"/blog/first/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/first/","section":"blog","summary":"Given a finite sequence of real numbers, how can one find the longest strictly increasing subsequence?","tags":null,"title":"Longest Ascending Subsequence","type":"blog"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Nakahara Errata.\nOver the course of my PhD I worked my way through the first 12 chapters of Geometry, Topology and Physics by Mikio Nakahara.
