The heavy Higgs and massive gauge bosons can be ignored, leaving a theory of massless gauge bosons and several flavours of Dirac fermion. We will discuss the continuous global symmetries of this theory, focusing on the quark sector.\nFlavour Symmetries With $n_f$ flavours of quark, the largest possible global symmetry group consists of independent unitary rotations of the left-handed quarks and the right-handed quarks, that is, $U(n_f)_L \\times U(n_f)_R $. Such symmetries are sometimes called flavour symmetries. Ignoring discrete symmetry quotients, this can be written $$ SU(n_f)_L \\times SU(n_f)_R \\times U(1)_L \\times U(1)_R \\ .$$ It is sometimes useful to rewrite left- and right-handed rotations in terms of rotations of both chiralities by the same amount and by opposite amounts. Such symmetries are called vector symmetries and axial symmetries respectively. Thus we are tempted to write the above symmetry group as $$ SU(n_f)_V \\times SU(n_f)_A \\times U(1)_V \\times U(1)_A \\ .$$ In fact there is a small subtlety here. It is not the case that axial special unitary transformations form a group (they are not closed under composition). More precisely, we should think of $SU(n_f)_A$ as the coset $SU(n_f)_L \\times SU(n_f)_R / SU(n_f)_V$.\nExact Symmetries Such a symmetry is exact when all the quarks are massless. If the quarks are not massless but all have the same mass, the vector symmetry is exact but none of the axial symmetries are. In the case that all the quark masses are different and non-zero, as in reality, the exact symmetry group is $U(1)_V^{n_f}$, corresponding to number conservation of each quark flavour.\n Exercise: show that if there are $n_0$ massless quarks and $n_i$ quarks of mass $m_i \u0026gt; 0$, then the exact symmetry group is $$ U(n_0)_R \\times U(n_0)_L \\times \\prod_i U(n_i)_V \\ .$$\n In the Standard Model, the lightest three quarks (the up, down, and strange) have sufficiently small masses that for $n_f = 3$ we can consider $U(n_f) \\times U(n_f)$ to be a good approximate symmetry. It is an even better approximate symmetry for $n_f = 2$.\nSpontaneous Symmetry Breaking All axial symmetries are broken by the vacuum due to the non-zero VEV of the quark bilinears $\\bar{q}q$. Note that the broken gauge symmetry $SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y$, acting on quarks, is in fact a subgroup of $U(n_f)_L \\times U(n_f)_R$, provided we take $n_f = 6$. And indeed, spontaneous breaking of the axial symmetries translates into spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry down to $U(1)_Q$. One might wonder, therefore, whether the chiral condensate alone could be responsible for this pattern of symmetry breaking. However, this will naturally give the gauge bosons masses of order the QCD scale (around $100\\ \\mathrm{MeV})$ rather than the observed scale of $100\\ \\mathrm{GeV}$. Furthermore, the Higgs serves a second purpose in the Standard Model (in addition to breaking electroweak symmetry), which is to give masses to the quarks and leptons. Without the Higgs, the gauge symmetry can only be exact if all the quarks and leptons are massless, which is not the case.\nAnomalies As well as being inexact and spontaneously broken by the vacuum, the axial symmetries are also anomalous. In particular, axial $U(1)_A$ suffers both a QCD anomaly and a QED anomaly. There is also one generator of axial $SU(n_f)_A$ which suffers a QED anomaly \u0026mdash; for $n_f = 3$ this is $\\lambda_8 + \\sqrt{3} \\lambda_3$. The aforementioned QCD anomaly is the supposed explanation for the lack of a fourth ($n_f = 2$) or ninth ($n_f = 3$) light meson.\nOne might suspect that the QED anomaly suffered by $SU(n_f)_A$ would also raise the masses of some of the other light mesons. This is a rather complicated story which we will briefly discuss in Part IV. For the present moment we note that if we neglect electric charge ($e = 0$), the only anomalous current is that corresponding to axial $U(1)_A$: $$ \\partial_\\mu J_5^\\mu = -\\frac{n_f g_s^2}{32 \\pi^2} \\epsilon^{\\mu \\nu \\rho \\sigma}F^a_{\\mu \\nu} F^a_{\\rho \\sigma} \\ .$$\nThe Lepton Sector In principle a similar study is warranted of the global continuous symmetries of the lepton sector. However, this is vastly more simple. Firstly, without the strong dynamics of QCD, there is no chiral condensate, so no spontaneous symmetry breaking. Secondly, the lepton masses are sufficiently different that no flavour symmetry can fairly be called approximate. We note, however, that to the extent that any $U(n_f)_L \\times U(n_f)_R$ flavour symmetry could be considered approximate, the axial symmetries would suffer a QED anomaly as in the quark case.\n Exercise: As we stated in Part I, a generator $T$ of $SU(n_f)_A$ suffers a QED anomaly if $\\mathrm{tr}(TQ^2) \\neq 0$, where $Q$ is the generator of electric charge. Show that in general there is one such anomalous generator, but that if we consider a flavour symmetry amongst only the charged leptons, or only the neutrinos, then there is no QED anomaly.\n Summary     Approximate SSB Anomalous     $SU(3)_V$ Yes* No No   $SU(3)_A$ Yes Yes QED ($\\lambda_8 + \\sqrt{3} \\lambda_3$)   $U(1)_V$ No No No   $U(1)_A$ Yes Yes QCD and QED    *Note that the two diagonal generators of $SU(3)_V$ are exact symmetries.

Understanding it in detail takes time, but understanding the symmetries of the theory provides a framework with which to understand these details.\nSymmetries can be classified along many lines. They can be continuous or discrete, global or local, approximate or exact, anomalous, spontaneously broken, and so on. In this series, we will endeavour to discuss each and every symmetry of the Standard Model, and classify them according to each of the categories above.\nIn Part I, we will give a schematic overview of the structure of the Standard Model and its gauge symmetries. In Parts II and III we will consider global continuous symmetries, first from the perspective of the low-energy theory, and then from the perspective of the high-energy theory. In Part IV we will consider the discrete symmetries $C$, $P$, and $T$, and in Part V we will collect these results together and discuss how they are affected by some extensions to the theory.\nGauge Symmetries The starting point for the construction of the Standard Model is the gauge group\n$$ SU(3)_C \\times SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y \\ , $$\nwhere the first factor represents the colour symmetry of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and the second two factors (known as weak isospin and hypercharge) represent the symmetry of the electroweak interactions.\nThe Field Content The Standard Model contains gauge bosons corresponding to each of the gauge groups described above, along with $n_g = 3$ generations of Weyl fermions in the following representations, as well as a single scalar field, the Higgs:\n    $SU(3)_C$ $SU(2)_L$ $U(1)_Y$     $Q_L$ Fundamental Fundamental $Y = 1/6$   $u_R$ Fundamental Trivial $Y = 2/3$   $d_R$ Fundamental Trivial $Y = -1/3$   $L_L$ Trivial Fundamental $Y = -1/2$   $e_R$ Trivial Trivial $Y = -1$   $\\nu_R$ Trivial Trivial $Y = 0$   $\\phi$ Trivial Fundamental $Y = 1/2$    The Lagrangian The most general renormalizable Lagrangian with the above gauge symmetry and field content is the Standard Model. We can group the terms in the Lagrangian into four classes:\n Kinetic terms for the gauge fields. Kinetic terms for the fermions, including coupling to the gauge fields. Kinetic terms for the Higgs and Higgs self-interactions. Yukawa couplings between the fermions and the Higgs.  Schematically, this Lagrangian is:\n$$ \\begin{align} \\mathcal{L} = \u0026amp;-\\frac{1}{4} F^a_{\\mu \\nu} F^{a\\mu \\nu} \\\\ \u0026amp;+ \\bar{\\psi} i \\gamma^\\mu D_\\mu \\psi \\\\ \u0026amp;+ |D_\\mu \\phi|^2 - V(\\phi) \\\\ \u0026amp;- Y_d \\bar{Q}_L \\phi d_R - Y_u \\bar{Q}_{L} \\phi^c u_R + \\mathrm{h.c.} \\\\ \u0026amp;- Y_e \\bar{L}_L \\phi e_R - Y_\\nu \\bar{L}_{L} \\phi^c \\nu_R + \\mathrm{h.c.} \\end{align} $$\nThere is an additional class of term one can add to the Lagrangian whose effects are more subtle. These are the theta terms, one for each factor of the gauge group:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_\\theta = \\frac{\\theta g^2}{64 \\pi^2} \\epsilon^{\\mu \\nu \\rho \\sigma} F^a_{\\mu \\nu} F^a_{\\rho \\sigma} \\ . $$\nWe will ignore these terms until Part IV.\nExact Symmetries The Lagrangian above has many approximate global symmetries which we will discuss in due course. The extent to which these symmetries are approximate is dictated by the various parameters of the theory. For general choices of these parameters (and in reality) the Standard Model has only two exact global continuous symmetries. These are baryon number and lepton number. They are not enforced upon the theory \u0026mdash; rather, it is simply not possible to write down renormalizable terms respecting the overall gauge symmetry which violate baryon or lepton number. We sometimes say such symmetries are accidental.\nSpontaneous Symmetry Breaking A symmetry is spontaneously broken if it is respected by the Lagrangian but not by the vacuum of the theory. Spontaneous symmetry breaking is typically caused by fields acquiring a non-zero expectation value in the vacuum. In the Standard Model, there are two sources of spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n  The Higgs field $\\phi$ acquires a non-zero VEV. This breaks the gauge symmetry thus: $$ SU(3)_C \\times SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y \\to SU(3)_C \\times U(1)_Q \\ .$$ It also breaks some approximate global symmetries. This is known as electroweak symmetry breaking. The unbroken $U(1)_Q$ symmetry is the symmetry of quantum electrodynamics (QED). We will discuss this further in Part III.\n  At a lower energy scale, the quark bilinears $\\bar{q}q$ acquire a non-zero VEV (equal in magnitude for each flavour). This breaks no further gauge symmetries, but does break some approximate global symmetries. This is known as chiral symmetry breaking. We will discuss this further in Part II.\n  Anomalies A symmetry is anomalous if it is respected by the Lagrangian but not by the path integral measure. For a symmetry $H$ with generators $t^a$ and a gauge symmetry $G$ with generators $T^a$, we say that $H$ suffers a $G$-anomaly if the anomaly coefficient\n$$ \\mathrm{tr}(\\gamma^5 t^a \\{T^b, T^c\\}) $$\nis non-zero. In principle it is possible for anomalies to arise from diagrams with three different currents, but this cannot happen in the Standard Model since such diagrams always involve exactly one generator of $SU(2)_L$ or $SU(3)_C$, which is traceless. It is a somewhat magical feature of the Standard Model, which one should check from the table of field representations above, that no gauge symmetry $H$ suffers a $G$-anomaly for any gauge symmetry $G$. Indeed, this is necessary for the theory to be consistent. Nevertheless, there are several global symmetries $H$ which suffer $G$-anomalies, as we shall see.\nSummary     Approximate SSB Anomalous     $SU(3)_C$ No No No   $SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y$ No Down to $U(1)_Q$ No   $U(1)_Q$ No No No    ","date":1632182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632182400,"objectID":"fa710aa32f890d12853a9b3670ff1c6b","permalink":"/blog/sm1/","publishdate":"2021-09-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/sm1/","section":"blog","summary":"The structure of the Standard Model.","tags":null,"title":"Symmetries of the Standard Model I: Overview","type":"blog"},{"authors":["George Johnson"],"categories":["Graph Theory"],"content":"The Problem It is well known that one cannot connect each of three homes to each of three utilities, without any of the lines of connection crossing, if those lines are restricted to lie in a plane (or equivalently, on the surface of a sphere). Mathematically, we say that the complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$ is not planar.\nHowever, it is possible to draw such a graph on the surface of a torus. Indeed, on a torus it is possible to connect each of four homes to each of four utilities, without any lines of connection crossing (an exercise for the curious).\nA natural question to ask is: what is the surface of lowest genus $g$ on which it is possible to connect $n$ homes to $n$ utilities, without crossings?\nA Bound Here is a lower bound on the genus required. Suppose the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ can be drawn without crossings on the genus-$g$ surface. Let $e = n^2$ denote the number of edges in the graph, $f$ the number of faces, and let $\\chi = 2 - 2g$ denote the Euler characteristic of the surface.\nThe shortest cycle in $K_{n,n}$ has length four. Thus each face of the graph must have at least four sides, and since each side is shared by two faces, we must have\n$$ 2 e \\geq 4 f \\ .$$\nBy definition, we have $2n - e + f = \\chi$.

A sequence of length $k$ has $2^k$ subsequences and checking each case may not be feasible.\nA Solution Suppose our sequence begins $(1,10,11,12,2,3,\\ldots)$. If we begin our subsequence with $a_1 = 1$, we are left with the decision whether to next take $a_2 = 10$, thus committing to the exclusion of $a_5$ and $a_6$, or whether perhaps to skip the second to fourth elements in the hope of finding more elements less than $a_2$ further down the line. Which decision is better could depend on elements all the way to the end of the sequence.\nThus, one is tempted to start thinking from the other end. Suppose we begin with $a_k$. Clearly there is nowhere else to go, and our longest subsequence will have length one. Now suppose we begin with $a_{k-1}$. We have hardly more choice in this case: we include $a_k$ if it is greater than $a_{k-1}$, and not otherwise.\nNow suppose we begin with $a_{k-2}$. We have already determined the longest subsequence beginning with $a_i$ for each $i \u0026gt; k-2$. Thus, we need only check which such $a_i$ satisfy $a_i \u0026gt; a_{k-2}$, and of those, prepend $a_{k-2}$ to the longest corresponding subsequence. This will generate the longest subsequence beginning with $a_{k-2}$.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s clear we can continue this process, tracking backwards through the sequence to determine the longest ascending subsequence beginning with each element, and once this is complete we can choose the longest among them as our solution.\nAn Implementation One way to implement this idea uses Python dictionaries:\na = [1,10,11,12,2,3,4,13,14,15,5,6,7,8] k = len(a) # prepend a small number a_0 so that the longest subsequence necessarily begins with a_0 a = [min(a)-1] + a # create a dictionary of the longest subsequences starting from a_i longsubseq = {k : [a[-1]]} for i in reversed(range(k)): # restrict the dictionary to those j with a_j \u0026gt; a_i lss = {j: longsubseq[j] for j in range(i, k+1) if a[j] \u0026gt; a[i]} # from these choose m such that a_m begins the longest subsequence m = max(lss, key = lambda j: len(lss[j]), default = 0) # append this subsequence to a_i if m == 0: subseq = [a[i]] else: subseq = [a[i]] + longsubseq[m] longsubseq[i] = subseq solution = longsubseq[0][1:]  I don\u0026rsquo;t know that Python dictionaries are necessarily the fastest way to implement this idea, but they are conceptually clean at least.\n","date":1619568000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619568000,"objectID":"471f7c95685b43e7cf93ad492f68404a","permalink":"/blog/first/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/first/","section":"blog","summary":"Given a finite sequence of real numbers, how can one find the longest strictly increasing subsequence?","tags":null,"title":"Longest Ascending Subsequence","type":"blog"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Nakahara Errata.\nOver the course of my PhD I worked my way through the first 12 chapters of Geometry, Topology and Physics by Mikio Nakahara.
